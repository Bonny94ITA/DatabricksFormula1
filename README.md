# DatabricksFormula1

This project aims to analyze and visualize data from Formula 1 races using the power of Databricks and Apache Spark. Through a series of notebooks, we will explore the performance of different teams and drivers, as well as trends and patterns in the data.
Prerequisites

In order to complete this project, you will need:

   - A Databricks account (sign up for a free trial at databricks.com)
   - Access to the Formula 1 dataset, which can be obtained from Ergast Developer API or other sources
   - Basic knowledge of Databricks, Spark SQL, and DataFrames

## Setup

   - Clone or download this repository to your local machine
   - Import the project notebooks into your Databricks workspace
   - Follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the code and complete the exercises

## Exercises

The project consists of the following exercises:

   - Data ingestion: In this exercise, you will learn how to import the Formula 1 dataset into Databricks from a CSV file or a REST API.
   - Data exploration: In this exercise, you will learn how to use Spark SQL and DataFrames to explore and summarize the data, and identify interesting trends and patterns.
   - Data visualization: In this exercise, you will learn how to use Databricks and visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative and interactive plots and charts.
